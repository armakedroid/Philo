## 📘 Overview
In this project, you will learn the basics of **threading** and **process management** in C.  
You will create threads and explore the use of **mutexes** to prevent data races and manage shared resources safely.  

The project includes both a **mandatory part** (threads + mutexes) and a **bonus part** (processes + semaphores).
